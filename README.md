# Beer-Overflow
Live App: https://mitch4444.github.io/API_Capstone.io/

This app allows users to search for a beer by entering an alcohol percentage. The app then returns beers with an ABV higher than the number entered. Technologies included in the quiz are HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This app is good for users who would like to experiment with different beers and food. After returning beers that match it also gives food recomendations.
